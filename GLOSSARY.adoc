== Behaviour Driven Development

A collaborative practice where teams use conversations around business rules and concrete examples to build up a shared understanding of customer needs. The team selects some key examples as the basis for acceptance criteria, which can be automated in the form of executable specifications.

== Executable Specifications

Acceptance Criteria that have been written in a form that can be executed automatically. For high-level acceptance criteria, tools like Cucumber and JBehave are often used to automate acceptance criteria.

== Gherkin

The semi-formal language used by Cucumber to express executable specifications. Gherkin uses the Given..When..Then notation, like the following:

  Given Joe has a todo list containing 6 completed tasks
