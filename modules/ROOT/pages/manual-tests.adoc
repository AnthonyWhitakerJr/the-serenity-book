= Reporting Manual Test Results

Serenity is primarily designed to report the results of _automated_ acceptance tests. However, there are times when some tests need to be done manually. And it is useful to report these tests in the overall test reports, to get a broader picture of test coverage.

To make this easier, Serenity with Cucumber provides some support for recording and reporting manual test results.

You can mark a test as a manual test using the `@manual` tag, e.g.

```
@Manual
Scenario: Monitoring a new low risk customer
  Given Joe is a new customer
  And Joe is considered a low risk customer
  When he is onboarded
  Then his account should be scheduled for review in 3 months time
```

This will appear in the reports as a manual test, as shown below.

By default, manual tests are reported as "pending", like the one above. The individual steps will be marked as ignored, as they are just there for documentation purposes.

You can override this status, and mark a test explicitly as a passing or failing test, like this:

```
@Manual:Passed
Scenario: Monitoring a new low risk customer
  Given Joe is a new customer
  And Joe is considered a low risk customer
  When he is onboarded
  Then his account should be scheduled for review in 3 months time
```

Or if you want to report that a manual test was unsuccessful:

```
@Manual:Failed
Scenario: Monitoring a new low risk customer
  Given Joe is a new customer
  And Joe is considered a low risk customer
  When he is onboarded
  Then his account should be scheduled for review in 3 months time
```

The test will then appear as both a manual and a failing test:

.A failing manual test reported in Serenity

If you need to provide more details about the test failure, you can add a note starting with the "Failure:" keyword underneath the scenario title, e.g.

```
@manual:failed
Scenario: Monitoring a new low risk customer
  Failure:Joe is showing as a high-risk customer

  Given Joe is a new customer
  And Joe is considered a low risk customer
  When he is onboarded
  Then his account should be scheduled for review in 3 months time
```

This error message will then appear in the report:

.A failing manual test including an error message.

Manual test results also appear in the overall test reports, where they are represented in a lighter shade of the normal test result colour:

.Manual tests appearing in a summary report

Note that you should use this feature with caution, as marking a manual test as passing may be misleading: if you are running your Serenity tests on a CI server, you cannot safely say that they were manually tested with the version that was built on the build server. For this reason, manual test results should be considered as indicative, not definitive.

Although Manual tests can have steps (like the one above), they are not really supposed to have step definitions. If Cucumber finds a step definition for a step, it will execute it, and this may not be what you intend if you mark a test as manual.
