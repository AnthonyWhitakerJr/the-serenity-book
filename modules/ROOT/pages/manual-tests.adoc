# Reporting Manual Test Results

One of the principles of BDD is to have a single source of truth for both the requirements that describe a feature, and the automated tests that verify them. And it is a natural step to want to include both automated and manual tests in this single source of truth.

Cucumber is primarily and traditionally used for automating executable specifications. But with Serenity BDD, you can add special tags to indicate that a scenario represents a manual test case.

## Recording manual test cases

You can flag any Cucumber scenario as manual simply by using the `@manual` tag:

----
@manual
Scenario: Invoice details should be downloadable as a PDF file
  The layout and content of the PDF file should be verified

  Given Clive has made a purchase
  When he reviews his past orders
  Then he should be able to download his invoice as an PDF file
----

This scenario will now appear as a manual test case in the Serenity reports:

[[manual-scenario]]

## Recording manual test results
By default, `@manual` scenarios are marked as _pending_ in the Serenity reports.
However, you can indicate a different result by adding the `@manual-result` tag as shown here:

* A passing test: `@manual-result:passed`
* A failing test: `@manual-result:failed`
* A compromised test: `@manual-result:compromised`

Note that if you want to record the result of a manual test, you should include both the `@manual` and the `@manual-result` tags.
This also makes it easier to run all of the manual tests in isolation.

These manual test results are indicated in a different shade in the Serenity reports, and also appear in the summary table on the home page:

## Updating manual test results

Manual test results are generally only valid for a given version of an application - when a new version is built, the manual tests may need to be redone.

Different projects deal with manual testing in different ways. For example some teams refer to a target release version, and test against this version when a new feature or story is ready to test. They do not, for example, feel the need to redo every manual test for each commit. They assess on a case-by-case basis whether any given changes might impact the features that have already been tested.

For example, suppose that a team is working towards a release at the end of the 15th sprint of their project.

----
@manual
@manual:passed
@manual-last-tested:sprint-15
Scenario: Invoice details should be downloadable as a PDF file
   ...
----

In the Serenity properties or configuration file, the team also records the current version (or sprint number):
[source,properties]
----
current.target.version = sprint-15
----

When the manual tests are processed, this scenario will be reported as passing, because the `current.target.version` matches the `@last-tested` tag in the scenario.

However, in the next sprint, the target version is updated:
[source,properties]
----
current.target.version = sprint-16
----

Now, when the manual scenario is processed, it will be marked as _pending_,
with a note indicating that a new manual test is required:

[[manual-results-pending-retest]]
.An out-of-date manual test

## Attaching evidence

You can either include a link to an external site, or place an image in the `src/test/resources/assets` folder and include a relative link to this file (without the `assets` folder name), e.g.

[source,gherkin]
----
@manual
@manual-result:passed
@manual-last-tested:sprint-15
@manual-test-evidence:https://some.external/link.png
Scenario: Invoice details should be downloadable as a PDF file
   ...
----

or

[source,gherkin]
----
@manual
@manual-result:passed
@last-tested:sprint-15
@test-evidence:assets/some-screenshot.png
Scenario: Invoice details should be downloadable as a PDF file
   ...
----

Test Evidence is only displayed if the `@last-tested` annotation is defined.

## Updating manual test results in an existing test suite

Manual test results are not always updated at the same time as code changes.
You can update an existing set of test results by selectively running the manual scenarios.
